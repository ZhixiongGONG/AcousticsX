My name is Zhixiong GONG (龚志雄), an associate professor of physical and engineering acoustics at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China. I received the B.S. and [Ph.D. degrees (thesis)](https://github.com/ZhixiongGONG/AcousticsX.com/blob/23c3c315e9e2ad0359b414c391a19a16d2d4d0b9/files/Thesis_Gong_2018.pdf) in acoustics from [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), China in 2013, and 2018, respectively. During my Ph.D., I joined the Physical acoustics group led by Prof. [Philip L. MARSTON](https://physics.wsu.edu/people/faculty/p-marston/) as a visiting scholar from December 2016 to April 2018 in the U.S.A.. After that, I worked as an invited postdoc in the group [AIMAN-FILMS](https://www.iemn.fr/la-recherche/les-groupes/aiman-films/membres) with Prof. [Michaël BAUDOIN](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/en/michael-baudoin) at [CNRS UMR8520 IEMN](https://www.iemn.fr/) from December 2018 to November 2022 in France. I am an elected [Member](https://github.com/ZhixiongGONG/AcousticsX.com/blob/b0aad2b4a432513ff3edc26e57c2e1b3d975d162/files/2022full_election_letter_ASA%20Member.pdf) of the [Acoustical Society of America](https://acousticalsociety.org/) (since 2022) and a member of the [IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society](https://ieee-uffc.org/).

What do I do?
======
My present project aims at developing versatile acoustical tweezers (ATs). My research interests lie in physical acoustics, ultrasound, and ocean acoustics, especially including <b>acoustic manipulation of microparticles and microfluidics</b> and <b>bubble acoustics</b>.
