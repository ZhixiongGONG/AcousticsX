title: " Acoustical tweezers "
excerpt: "In particular we developed recently some general theories of acoustic radiation force and torque for ideal or arbitrary acoustic fields on arbitrary particles which is the foundation of acoustical tweezer technique. The theory has been successfully used to predict the radiation force on a cell trapped by a focused vortex in a microsystem experiment.<br/>
