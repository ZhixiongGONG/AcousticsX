title: "	Acoustic scattering and imaging "
excerpt: "We aim at developing a versatile home-made toolbox to investigate the scattering physics of general shapes and different materials (e.g., elastic, bubble, droplet, â€¦) and the inversed imaging technique based on the semi-analytical T-matrix method. This project is related to application in the field of ocean acoustics.<br/><img src='/images/Gong_JASA_EL.png'>"
