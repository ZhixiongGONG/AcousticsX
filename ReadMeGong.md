This file is to make some notes for me to edit the sources for the static website.

1. put all the .pdf filed in the "files" folder;
2. put all the figures/photos in the "images" foleder;
3. It is NOT possible to change the folder name on Github. One way is to clone it to the local PC and revise, then upload again...
4. "config.yml" is for the entire site, but NOT the homepage. Font page is the fiel "about.md" in the "page" folder.
5. If you need to change the BOLD name in the individual page, go to the folder "page", and edit the .html fiels, e.g., "portfolio.html".
6.
